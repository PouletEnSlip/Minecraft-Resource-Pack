## Download:
Download my pack on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/cotcotpack/).

## How to install:
Drag and drop the ZIP file in ```C:\Users\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\```

To run the resource pack, you can install [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home), but I highly recommend these Fabric mods for better performance:

* [Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium), [Phosphor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor) and [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium), for performance
* [Indium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/indium), to make Continuity work with Sodium
* [Continuity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity), for alternative textures (blocks)
* [CIT Resewn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn), for alternative textures (items)
* [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), for shaders
* [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders), the shader pack I use
