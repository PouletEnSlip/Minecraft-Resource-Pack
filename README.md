## Features:
* 3D models
* Alternative textures
* Animated items
* Connected textures
* Custom colormap/lightmap
* Custom CTM/CIT textures
* Custom dark GUI
* Custom skybox
* Custom sounds

To use all the features of the pack, you can install OptiFine, but I highly recommend these Fabric mods instead for better performance:

* [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), to improve performance
* [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity), for alternative textures (blocks)
* [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium), to make Continuity work with Sodium
* [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), for alternative textures (items)
* [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris), for shader packs
* [Complementary Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined), the shader pack I use

## Download:
Download my pack on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/cotcotpack/) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/cotcotpack).

## How to install:
Drag and drop the ZIP file in ``C:\Users\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\``.

## Update frequency:
I update the pack as soon as possible but sometimes I have to wait for Faithful and Continuity to update.
